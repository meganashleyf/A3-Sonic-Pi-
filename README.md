# A3-Sonic-Pi-

Details of my project -  

A soundtrack to a book. In this case, the book is 'Divine Rivals' by Rebecca Ross. Each file is named after the specific scene it represents, made on Sonic Pi. In ordeer to play these pieces of music, you will need Sonic Pi to be downloaded and you can copy and paste the code, into different pages (0,1,2,3) before pressing run, allowing you to play the music.
